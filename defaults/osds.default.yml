# This is a prepopulated osds.yml file


# There are two deployment scenarios that the deployments team will be responsible for: collocated and non-collocated deployments.
# If every single drive is a NVMe drive, reach out to RPC-STORAGE and we will handle it.


# I've included examples of what collocated and non-collocated configs will look like in this file. 
# You will have to edit these blocks to match your environment, but they will get you most of the way. 
# If you have any questions, reach out to RPC-STORAGE.

# This will always be lvm. Do not change this.

# Ceph Ansibe now uses the ceph-volume lvm batch command. This analyzes the drive layout on the servers and 
# builds partitions and osds in the most optimal way for the server. Now you just need a list of drives for 
# ceph to use. DO NOT LIST THE OS DRIVE!
