# CRUSH RULES #
###############
#crush_rule_config: true

#crush_rule_hdd:
#  name: replicated_hdd
#  root: default
#  type: host
#  class: hdd
#  default: true

#crush_rule_ssd:
#  name: replicated_ssd
#  root: default
#  type: host
#  class: ssd
#  default: false

#crush_rules:
#  - "{{ crush_rule_hdd }}"
#  - "{{ crush_rule_ssd }}"

# Caution: this will create crush roots and racks according to hostvars {{ osd_crush_location }}
# and will move hosts into them which might lead to significant data movement in the cluster!
#
# In order for the playbook to create CRUSH hierarchy, you have to setup your Ansible inventory file like so:
#
# [osds]
# ceph-osd-01 osd_crush_location="{ 'root': 'mon-roottt', 'rack': 'mon-rackkkk', 'pod': 'monpod', 'host': 'ceph-osd-01' }"
#
# Note that 'host' is mandatory and that you need to submit at least two bucket type (including the host)
#create_crush_tree: false
